## Coding Conventions

### Varnames, Getters and Setters

All class member variable names start with an underscore(_) Example: _minlen
Setters are named like the getter, def minlen(len:int) -> self, they can be chained.
There are no getters unless they compute a value, : def getMinMaxTuple()

### PyGDO Inheritance

There are basically three monster base classes.

 - [GDT](../gdo/base/GDT.py) (Gizmore Data Types)
 - [GDO](../gdo/base/GDO.py) (Gizmore Data Object - which is a GDT)
